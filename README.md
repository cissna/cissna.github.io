My Github is currently mostly things in progress.

My pinned repositories are the ones that are or will be finished projects, actually useful to the public.

The only currently finished one is `convert-math-homework-to-latex`, although it doesn't really do what it sounds like. It is just a streamlined workflow to use free web interfaces of AI tools (I use Gemini, since they give Pro for free to students). So all it does is make it easy to copy/paste between pictures of your written work and the web to convert it to LaTeX using AI. This is because I was wasting a lot of time writing the same prompts and doing the same actions.

`course-evaluation-scraper` is working if anyone wants to use it, but I want to deploy it to the web to make it more accessible. It's the best small project I've done as of yet because it democratizes some information that everyone at JHU could use. I personally have appreciated it a lot already.

`gite` has nothing done, just very extensive planning, but is perhaps what I'm most excited for, as it's actually interesting prompt engineering.

`ranker` is kind of dumb, but I was just inspired by Beli to create something that sorts a list by defining the > & = operations as "ask the user, what do they think?". This integrates interestingly with sorting algorithms (since the cost of comparisons is infinitely higher than swaps, theoretical Algorithms knowledge is actually useful). I wanted to integrate it with spreadsheets so I could sort things in a spreadsheet more easily (I was also going to do this with copy/paste), but I realized that copying spreadsheet formatting was too complicated, so I basically gave up. This isn't in a super public-friendly format.

`traveling-salesman-genetic-algorithm-continental-us-colleges` was my final project for my high school Algorithms class. I think it's pretty cool, and there are definitely some cool visualizations in there, but my file structuring and Git usage were really bad in high school, so it may be hard to navigate.

`nyt-letterboxed-solver` from the same class as above, cute PyGame solver for a random NYT game (like the Mini or Wordle) that I don't actually like very much anymore. But there's a fairly simple algorithm on the backend that solves it, and then I animated it to look exactly like the real game in PyGame (but the animations are a big jank).

I also have some cool private repos in the works...
other public repos are just random stuff, not a lot of value will be found there
