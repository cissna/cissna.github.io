# Isaac Cissna's Personal Website

This space will probably contain random things that interest me (and this will probably be changed if it doesn't ðŸ’€).

## First Update (2/1/2024)

I've just added an **Energy Consumption Calculator** for my physics class. This tool allows you to input various appliances, their wattages, and the number of hours they are used (and whether those hours are during peak hours), then estimates a monthly energy bill.

Feel free to explore the calculator and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

## Retrospectively Irrelevant Update (5/13/2025)

I'm planning on incorporating this with my jhu-course-evaluations-analysis to make a website where people can query a class and it will give them valuable information that is a pain to collect manually. I'm not exactly sure what the next step is, so I'm starting by deleting everything and I'll figure out what's next...next

## Real Update (5/15/2025)

Mildly discourouged about jhu-course-evaluations-analysis thing so I'm putting it on the backburner and using this to make a website for Mira.

## Refactoring Update (5/24/2025)
Realized that you can do github pages from any repo so moved Mira stuff to `for-mira` and now I'm going to delete this page (besides README :D)
