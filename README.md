This space will probably contain random things that interest me (and this will probably be changed if it doesn't ðŸ’€).

I've just added an **Energy Consumption Calculator** for my physics class. This tool allows you to input various appliances, their wattages, and the number of hours they are used (and whether those hours are during peak hours), then estimates a monthly energy bill.

Feel free to explore the calculator and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.
